# 📘 AP Computer Science Principles – Semester 1 Overview

Welcome to **AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP)**! This course offers a broad introduction to the foundational concepts of computer science and encourages students to think creatively, work collaboratively, and apply computational thinking to solve real-world problems.

> 🧠 AP CSP is more than just programming. It’s about understanding how computing shapes our world.

This repository contains materials and outlines for **Semester 1**, which is organized into 6 core modules—each spanning 3 weeks. Throughout these modules, students will gain hands-on programming experience using Python and develop the problem-solving skills that are essential to success in both the course and on the AP Exam.
