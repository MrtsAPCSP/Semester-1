# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Cheatsheet

**Big Idea 5: Impact of Computing – Cybersecurity (5.3)**

## 🔑 Key Concepts: CIA Triad

* **Confidentiality** – Preventing unauthorized access
* **Integrity** – Ensuring data is accurate and unaltered
* **Availability** – Ensuring data/services are accessible when needed

## 🔐 Threats & Attacks:

* **Phishing** – Tricking users into giving up information
* **Malware** – Software designed to harm a device or network
* **Keylogging** – Recording keystrokes to steal information
* **Brute Force Attack** – Trying many password combinations
* **DDoS** – Distributed Denial of Service (overwhelms servers)

## 🛠 Protections:

* **Encryption** (Symmetric & Asymmetric)
* **Firewall** – Filters network traffic
* **Antivirus Software** – Detects/removes threats
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
* **Password Best Practices** – Strong, unique, updated regularly

## 🔒 Encryption:

* **Symmetric** – Same key for encryption/decryption
* **Asymmetric** – Public/private key pair
* **TLS/SSL** – Secures web traffic
* **HTTPS** – HTTP over SSL/TLS (secure websites)

## 🔁 Digital Certificates:

* Verifies ownership of a public key
* Issued by **Certificate Authorities (CAs)**

# 🌐 Internet & Networking Cheatsheet

**Big Idea 4: Computer Systems and Networks**

## 📦 Core Concepts:

* **IP Address** – Unique device ID on a network
* **DNS** – Domain Name System (name → IP address)
* **TCP/IP** – Protocols for internet communication
* **Packets** – Small chunks of data sent across networks

## 📶 Protocols:

* **HTTP / HTTPS** – Used by web browsers
* **IP** – Addressing and routing
* **TCP** – Reliable, ordered delivery
* **UDP** – Faster, less reliable

## 🔁 Routing:

* **Routers** use IPs to forward packets
* **Fault-tolerant** – Multiple paths increase reliability
* **Scalable** – Handles growing number of devices

## 🧱 Layers of Abstraction:

1. **Physical Layer** – Cables, signals
2. **Data Link Layer** – MAC addresses
3. **Network Layer** – IP routing
4. **Transport Layer** – TCP/UDP
5. **Application Layer** – HTTP, DNS

## 🧩 Redundancy:

* Multiple paths = reliable, continuous communication

# 🧠 Data & Privacy Cheatsheet

**Big Idea 2: Data**
**Big Idea 5.4: Privacy & Legal Implications**

## 📊 Data Types:

* **Quantitative** – Measurable (e.g., age, income)
* **Qualitative** – Descriptive (e.g., color, type)
* **Structured** – Organized (e.g., databases, tables)
* **Unstructured** – Messy (e.g., text, images)

## 🔍 Data Collection:

* Sources: **Sensors, surveys, apps, websites**
* **Metadata** – Data about data (e.g., time, location)

## 📈 Analysis & Use:

* Find trends
* Make predictions
* Influence decisions (ads, policy, etc.)

## 👁️ Privacy Issues:

* **PII** – Personally Identifiable Information
* **Re-identification** risk from anonymized data
* **Data Aggregation** – Large-scale privacy threats

## ⚖️ Legal & Ethical:

* **Terms of Service** – User agreement
* **Bias** – In data, algorithms, and usage
* **Security** – Encryption, access control
* **Laws** – COPPA (US), GDPR (EU), etc.

# 🧮 Data Compression & Abstraction Cheatsheet

**Big Idea 2.1 & 2.2**

## 📦 Compression:

* **Lossless** – Original data is fully recoverable (e.g., ZIP, PNG)
* **Lossy** – Compresses by losing some data (e.g., JPEG, MP3)

## 🧱 Abstraction:

* **Simplifies complexity** by hiding lower-level details
* Examples:

  * Programming functions
  * File types (e.g., `.txt`, `.mp3`)
  * Protocols like TCP (hides packet details)

# 🧩 Algorithmic Thinking & Problem Solving Cheatsheet

**Big Idea 3.1 – 3.3**

## 🔄 Algorithms:

* **Sequencing** – Steps in logical order
* **Selection** – Use of conditions (if/else)
* **Iteration** – Loops (repeat, while)

## 🛠 Problem Solving Strategies:

* **Abstraction** – Ignore irrelevant details
* **Decomposition** – Break problems into parts
* **Heuristic** – Quick, approximate solutions when exact is too complex

## 📈 Algorithm Analysis:

* **Efficiency** – Time & space complexity
* **Search Algorithms**:

  * Linear Search
